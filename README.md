# 13_Mapping_Earthquake
## Project Overview
This project uses data provided by usgs.gov to show a visual repersentation of all of the earthquakes on the planet over the last 7 days. This project was created using Javascript's leaflet and d3 libraries, mapbox's api, and geoJson data from usgs.gov. The final product is in the earthquake_challenge folder.
